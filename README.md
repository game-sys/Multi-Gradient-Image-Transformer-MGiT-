# Multi-Gradient Image Transformer (MGiT)

Welcome to the official repository for the Multi-Gradient Image Transformer (MGiT), a novel approach for optimizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) on limited datasets by using a dual-training system with an auxiliary ViT model.

## About the Project

This project builds on the findings presented in our paper where we introduced a new methodology for enhancing the training efficiency and generalization capabilities of ViTs, especially when dealing with smaller datasets. MGiT leverages a simpler auxiliary ViT model to stabilize and improve the learning trajectory of a primary ViT model without extensive modifications to the architecture.

### Key Features

- **Efficiency**: MGiT reduces the need for large pre-training datasets.
- **Flexibility**: Compatible with standard ViT architectures without needing significant structural changes.
- **Enhanced Generalization**: Demonstrates improved performance on benchmark datasets through empirical evaluation.

## Code Release

The code for MGiT is currently under preparation and will be released soon. We are committed to providing a well-documented, robust implementation that can be easily integrated into existing projects.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install and set up MGiT will be provided here once the code is available.

## Usage

Upon release, this section will provide detailed instructions on how to implement MGiT in your projects, including sample code snippets and configuration settings.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you are interested in contributing to the MGiT project, please read through our contributing guidelines, which will be added to this repository. Contributions can include bug fixes, feature additions, and improvements to the documentation.
